This repository contains code for displaying results of sensitivity analysis, specifically plots that have first-, second-, and total-order indices. Please read the licence before using the code.

This code is designed to generate plots that show the results of sensitivity analysis by showing first-, total- and second-order indices at the same time. The plots are structured so that each variable has a location on the edge of a circle. At this location the first-order index and the total-order index are plotted, with the first-order index being a filled circle and the total-order index being a "halo" around it. The second-order indices are plotted as connecting lines between the points. The width of all of the plotting element (lines, points) are proportional to the sensitivity index.

There are many many options for determining what points will be plotted or adjusting the plot. The code is designed to have default parameters that are reasonably specified so the output looks acceptable. The input data to this code was output from the Python package 'SALib' (https://github.com/SALib/SALib), but other sensitivity output formatted in this manner could also be used. Depending on the type of sensitivity output not all methods of selecting significant parameters may apply.
